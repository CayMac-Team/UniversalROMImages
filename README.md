# Universal ROMs
ROM Images for Quadra/LC &amp; Others

You must have & use one of our new Universal ROM SIMMs in either 8MB or 4MB as this ROM has the ability to sense what machine it is in and adapat the SIMM to use the proper pinning for the machine. The Universal ROM will work in any of the original Macintosh IIsi base ROM compatible machines including the SE/30. When the LED on the SIMM is on, it is in the IIsi mode (in programmer and machine). When LED is off, it is in the LC/Quadra mode. It would be beneficial for you to have a ROMmate v2 programmer to change the image on your ROM SIMM.

### LIMITATION
Boot from ROM is only working with ZuluSCSI or blueSCSI attached. Will NOT work with others or spinner drives. This is a known issue at this time with all intentions to have a fix for it soon.

### **WARNING & Use At Own Risk Statement**
ROM modifactions is a Work In Progress and not all is 100% operational. Constant code changes are being made and new images released to provide additional features and abilities to the ROM images. Use at your own RISK and CayMac Vintage nor any of its team members are liable. There is NO warranty provided. This is a hobby for us all as such.
